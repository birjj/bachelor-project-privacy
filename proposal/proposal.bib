  abstract   = {With the fast development of Information Technology, a tremendous amount of data have been generated and collected for research and analysis purposes. As an increasing number of users are growing concerned about their personal information, privacy preservation has become an urgent problem to be solved and has attracted significant attention. Local differential privacy (LDP), as a strong privacy tool, has been widely deployed in the real world in recent years. It breaks the shackles of the trusted third party, and allows users to perturb their data locally, thus providing much stronger privacy protection. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the local differential privacy technology. We summarise and analyze state-of-the-art research in LDP and compare a range of methods in the context of answering a variety of queries and training different machine learning models. We discuss the practical deployment of local differential privacy and explore its application in various domains. Furthermore, we point out several research gaps, and discuss promising future research directions.},

  abstract  = {Today, websites commonly use third party web analytics services t obtain aggregate information about users that visit their sites. This information includes demographics and visits to other sites as well as user behavior within their own sites. Unfortunately, to obtain this aggregate information, web analytics services track individual user browsing behavior across the web. This violation of user privacy has been strongly criticized, resulting in tools that block such tracking as well as anti-tracking legislation and standards such as Do-Not-Track. These efforts, while improving user privacy, degrade the quality of web analytics. This paper presents the first design of a system that provides web analytics without tracking. The system gives users differential privacy guarantees, can provide better quality analytics than current services, requires no new organizational players, and is practical to deploy. This paper describes and analyzes the design, gives performance benchmarks, and presents our implementation and deployment across several hundred users.},

  abstract  = {Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response, or RAPPOR, is a technology for crowdsourcing statistics from end-user client software, anonymously, with strong privacy guarantees. In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.},

  abstract  = {The collection and analysis of telemetry data from user's devices is routinely performed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved user experience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics, while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection, but degrade rapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular, existing LDP algorithms are not suitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app usage statistics. In this paper, we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards repeated collection of counter data, with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical tasks, mean estimation and histogram estimation, our LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same accuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms. We conduct empirical evaluation on real-world counter datasets to verify our theoretical results. Our mechanisms have been deployed by Microsoft to collect telemetry across millions of devices.},
