    \item[Motivation] Differential privacy is a recently proposed measure of the level of privacy provided by random functions. It provides a formal measure for how much information a potential attacker can achieve from a perturbed data set, when the data perturbation consists of random noise.
    
    In global differential privacy, a global aggregator has access to the real data prior to perturbing it. This differs from local differential privacy, where users perturb their data before sending it to the aggregator.
    
    The goal of this bachelor project is to gain an understanding of 
differential privacy in general, with a particular focus on local differential 
privacy, and use that understanding to implement and evaluate prior art in differentially private analytics.

\item[Plan]
    The project will consist in 4 phases detailed below
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Survey of the state of the art in differential privacy (tentatively February-March). 
The survey will start by consulting \cite{desfontain_overview}, i.e., a reading 
list of key papers in differential privacy presented as a semi-technical blog 
series on differential privacy. Moreover, we will also read 
\cite{localdiffpriv_survey}, i.e., a recent survey on local differential privacy 
methods for various use cases.
     \item Survey of existing frameworks for differential privacy within the field of analytics (tentatively March-April).
Candidates for this include \cite{rappor}, \cite{prochlo}, \cite{multidimensional_localdiff} and \cite{microsoft_telemetry}.
     \item Implementation and evaluation of a prototype based on one of the surveyed frameworks (tentatively April).
     \item Report writing (tentatively April-May). The final report will be written 
following the academic conventions~\cite{writing_conventions}.
    \end{itemize}
    
\item[Risks] The surveyed frameworks may not be feasable to implement within the expected timeframe.
In that case it may be preferable to focus on the theoretical evaluation, instead of implementing the prototype.

\item[Outcomes]
At the end of the project, the outcomes of the project will be
\begin{itemize}
\item A report written in English and following the standard academic writing
    conventions. The report will contain the description of the 
state-of-the-art, the description of the prototype and its preliminary 
evaluation.
\item The code of the prototype and the data for the experiments performed
\end{itemize}
